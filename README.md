My project is a 2d game, where the goal is to save the panda, by avoiding other dangerous animals, such as a rhino, a crocodile and a bear. This is my first visual game created, and I changed the initial idea of feeding panda to saving panda, as I wanted to change the game mechanism. Enjoy the game :)
